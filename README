Simple Clans Stats 2

The installation for this Simple Clans extension is very simple. You simply add
all the files into either the root, or a directory within your Website. I recommend
a directory.

After putting all the files into your selected folder, you need to modify
config.inc.php to contain your MySQL login details (and possibly your DynMap details).
I have left some default values in that I assume you might be using. 

For this web interface to work, you will need to be running SimpleClans2 in MySQL Mode.
To find out how to do this, consult the SimpleClans BukkitDev page:
